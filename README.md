# Honeypot Assignment

**Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

**Objective:** Create a honeynet using MHN-Admin. Present your findings as if you were requested to give a brief report of the current state of Internet security. Assume that your audience is a current employer who is questioning why the company should allocate anymore resources to the IT security team.

### MHN-Admin Deployment (Required)

**Summary:** How did you deploy it? Did you use GCP, AWS, Azure, Vagrant, VirtualBox, etc.?

I deployed the MHN by following the milestone instructions and commands given to help me follow through completing the assignment. I used GCloud for the processes and running through VMs in my terminal.

### Dionaea Honeypot Deployment (Required)

**Summary:** Briefly in your own words, what does dionaea do?
In my own words, I would say that dionaea since being a script is copying the malware and being able to capture and expose vulnerabilities through running networks against it.

I firstly encountered many issues at the beginning with setup and got assistance from a fellow classmate, after that I was able to get the ball rolling and then completed the assignment swiftly. My only issue was being able to get gif recordings since for some reason my computer doesn't get the screen I am working on however this time I got screenshots while working on the assignment.
